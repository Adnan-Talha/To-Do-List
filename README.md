# To-Do-List

A To-Do List web project created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to create a list of tasks they need to complete.
The interface includes an input field where users can add items to the list and a checkbox to mark items as completed.
The design is created using JavaScript to allow users to edit and delete items.
This project is a simple yet practical tool for organizing tasks and managing time effectively.
